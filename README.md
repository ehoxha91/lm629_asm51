# lm629_asm51
Assembly code for 8051 and LM629(pid controller)

This code is written to control LM629 with 8051 microcontroller.

To test this code you need:
                            1. LM629
                            2. 8051 MCU
                            3. LCD(standard)

Using 8051 input pins you can control:  Proportional Kp, Derivative Kd and integral Ki constants,
                                        Resolution of ENCODERS connected to the LM629,
                                        Referent position,
                                        Home position etc.

I wrote this code for a project on University of Prishtina.
This code is completed but you can add way much more.

Feel free to ask all sort of questions you need!
